# Automating Walker: An introduction to python for NumFOCUS
Each month our dear friend Walker emails all NumFOCUS project and asks for 
updates. While quite kind of him this process is quite manual. In this
intro we will be showing how python can be used to help Walker with
finding project updates.

The goal of this session is to introduce NumFOCUS to the python language
with the aid of a function example. We will be scraping pypi for package updates
and list the most recent update for the set of NumFOCUS projects. 

This project aims for a minimal just in time approach, where we introduce the
the useful language components to achieve the above goal. It is not 
intended to be comprehensive, but instead a programming primer.

Specifically we will cover
* Python environments  using Anaconda
* Python language features 
* Installing packages from pypi
* Importing modules
* Parsing standard file formats (XML in this case)

At the end of this tutorial our hope is the student is able to recognize
basic python language constructs and be able to extend the example
to all NumFOCUS projects.
